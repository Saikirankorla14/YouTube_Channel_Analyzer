📌 Project Overview
This project develops a tool that leverages the **YouTube API** to analyze a channel’s performance and predict the potential views for new videos. By analyzing metadata such as titles, tags, and descriptions, the tool provides actionable insights that creators can use to optimize their content for maximum reach and engagement.
🎯 Goal
To build a system that:
- Fetches YouTube channel and video data via the YouTube API.
- Analyzes channel performance metrics (views, likes, comments, engagement rate).
- Predicts the view count of a new video based on metadata such as title, tags, and description.
- Provides insights and recommendations for optimizing video metadata.
📂 Dataset
Dataset: Data fetched dynamically via the YouTube Data API v3.

Key Features Extracted:
- Video Title
- Tags
- Description
- Publish Date & Time
- Video Duration
- Historical Engagement Metrics (views, likes, comments)

Target:
- Predicted Video Views (regression task).
🛠️ Skills & Techniques
- **API Usage:** Fetching real-time channel and video data from YouTube Data API v3.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Text analysis on video titles, tags, and descriptions.
- **Regression Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost to predict video views.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting keyword frequency, sentiment, metadata length, posting time.
- **Visualization:** Charts and plots to show channel performance trends.
📌 Workflow
1. API Integration (fetch channel & video data).
2. Data Preprocessing (clean text, handle missing values).
3. Feature Engineering (NLP-based features, posting trends).
4. Model Training (regression models for view prediction).
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R² for accuracy).
6. Dashboard/Tool Development (creator-friendly interface with insights).
✅ Expected Outcomes
- A tool for YouTube creators to analyze their channel performance.
- Predictive model for estimating video views based on metadata.
- Recommendations for optimizing titles, tags, and descriptions.
- Visual insights into posting patterns and engagement trends.
